      <h1>Data Driven Products Now!</h1>
      <p>
        This talk attempts to explain opportunity sizing as simply as possible.
        The narrative is about building things at Etsy in the several years
        before I left. I wrote this in 2014, and presented it 30 times or so.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be noted that product process at Etsy continued to change after I left.

              I got my start in the financial industry back in the early 2000’s. I did that for a few years and then I freaked out and wound up at a startup called Etsy, in Brooklyn. That was back in 2007. I left Etsy in 2014 and have done several things since.

              I’d say at all points, this was more or less the company line. We should be data driven. Someone heard that Google was data driven, and we wanted to be like Google. So we should be data driven. There was one problem with this.

              But I think it’s also important to be honest. Etsy grew geometrically because it was a thing that was out there waiting to be discovered. It didn’t grow that way because of carefully planned product and marketing efforts.<br /><br />Sure, there was agency in the creation of the site. And people worked hard. But the massive growth that happened wasn’t strongly connected to the actions of employees. This is utterly obvious to those of us that were there. <br />

              But few of us, as human beings, are hardwired to see things that way. Instead we all tend to think that if your work takes off, it means you’re smart and your actions are good.<br /><br />We assume that the methods that precede success caused it, and they’re good methods.<br />

              A thing I noticed (and I’m sure I wasn’t the only person to notice this) was that we had been consistently deleting features after a while because nobody wound up using them. <br /><br />We’d release a feature, and a year or two later it would need maintenance or become a support headache. At that point we’d look to see if anyone was using it, and pretty often the answer would be “no.” So we’d just kill the thing.

              A good example of that is a feature called Alchemy. This was a feature that let you describe an item you wanted, and then have Etsy shop owners bid on making it for you. <br /><br />That’s a neat idea, and it was in the New York times a few times and was generally considered awesome when it came out back in 2008.

              But then we took it down for good in 2011. I looked into it at the time, and I think the statistic was that in three years Alchemy sold about as many items as the rest of the site sells in less than a day. It was a giant bust.<br /><br />Around that time I started wondering if there was some way I could avoid participating in projects like alchemy that were just going to be taken down.

              Around the same time we started A/B testing things in earnest. And I latched onto that as a possible solution. Instead of pushing things out to everyone all at once we’d do a split test and try to get a quantitative measure of how we were doing.

              The thing that A/B testing revealed right away was: holy crap! We’ve been delusional about our abilities up to this point.<br /><br />A huge percentage of products that we tested either had no effect, or made things worse. Usually only slightly worse, but still. And we certainly weren’t moving the needle in the right direction the way we expected.

              The general idea would be: Etsy already has these landing pages for all of its categories.

              Going one step further would be to see how many people buy things that they first encountered on each of these pages. And that looks like this. If you do that the project looks a little less attractive, because these pages really don’t sell many items.<br /><br />That doesn’t necessarily mean that the browse pages are bad. It’s probably just that the traffic on those pages tends to be pretty removed from the purchasing decision. <br /><br />Compare that to the search page, which is disproportional in the other direction. Once you’ve gone to the trouble of typing a search, you’re a lot more likely to be in buying mode.

              But, hold on a second. Furniture is very expensive. So maybe this is still worth digging into. <br /><br />Sure, we won’t sell a lot of items total, but the ones we do sell will cost a lot more. <br /><br />If the average order on Etsy is $40—which by the way it’s not, I am making up financial details in this talk—let’s guess that the average order we’ll create will be ten times that.

              There’s one thing to consider here, which is that Etsy doesn’t keep all of the money when an item sells. Etsy only takes 3.5% of the purchase price as a fee. So if we include that it adds some additional context. <br /><br />The net benefit to Etsy for this feature starts to look pretty bad. If two engineers work on this for a month and they have a designer half of the time, then this feature would take a long time to earn back their salaries. Not to mention HR overhead, managerial overhead, the incremental electricity required to run the feature, etc.
